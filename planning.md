# FitFindr — planning.md

> Complete this document before writing any implementation code.
> Your spec and agent diagram are what you'll use to direct AI tools (Claude, Copilot, etc.) to generate your implementation — the more specific they are, the more useful the generated code will be.
> Your planning.md will be reviewed as part of your submission.
> Update it before starting any stretch features.

## Tools

List every tool your agent will use. For each tool, fill in all four fields.
You must have at least 3 tools. The three required tools are listed — add any additional tools below them.

### Tool 1: search_listings

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `description` (str): ...
- `size` (str): ...
- `max_price` (float): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value — what fields does a result contain? -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if no listings match? -->

---

### Tool 2: suggest_outfit

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `new_item` (dict): ...
- `wardrobe` (dict): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if the wardrobe is empty or no outfit can be suggested? -->

---

### Tool 3: create_fit_card

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `outfit` (...): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if the outfit data is incomplete? -->

---

### Additional Tools (if any)

<!-- Copy the block above for any tools beyond the required three -->

---

## Planning Loop

**How does your agent decide which tool to call next?**
<!-- Describe the logic your planning loop uses. What does it look at? What conditions change its behavior? How does it know when it's done? -->

---

## State Management

**How does information from one tool get passed to the next?**
<!-- Describe how your agent stores and accesses state within a session. What data is tracked? How is it passed between tool calls? -->

---

## Error Handling

For each tool, describe the specific failure mode you're handling and what the agent does in response.

| Tool | Failure mode | Agent response |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| search_listings | No results match the query | |
| suggest_outfit | Wardrobe is empty | |
| create_fit_card | Outfit input is missing or incomplete | |

---

## Architecture

<!-- Draw a diagram of your agent showing how the components connect:
     User input → Planning Loop → Tools (search_listings, suggest_outfit, create_fit_card)
                                                                          ↕
                                                                   State / Session
     Show what triggers each tool, how state flows between them, and where error paths branch off.
     ASCII art, a Mermaid diagram (https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html), or an embedded
     sketch are all fine. You'll share this diagram with an AI tool when asking it to implement
     the planning loop and each individual tool. -->

---

## AI Tool Plan

<!-- For each part of the implementation below, describe:
     - Which AI tool you plan to use (Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
     - What you'll give it as input (which sections of this planning.md, your agent diagram)
     - What you expect it to produce
     - How you'll verify the output matches your spec before moving on

     "I'll use AI to help me code" is not a plan.
     "I'll give Claude my Tool 1 spec (inputs, return value, failure mode) and ask it to implement
     search_listings() using load_listings() from the data loader — then test it against 3 queries
     before trusting it" is a plan. -->

**Milestone 3 — Individual tool implementations:**

**Milestone 4 — Planning loop and state management:**

## A Complete Interaction (Step by Step)

Write out what a full user interaction looks like from start to finish — tool call by tool call. Use a specific example query.

**Example user query:** "I'm looking for a vintage graphic tee under $30. I mostly wear baggy jeans and chunky sneakers. What's out there and how would I style it?"

**Step 1:**
<!-- What does the agent do first? Which tool is called? With what input? -->
The agent will create a fresh session dict then it will parse the query to extract the description, size, max_price. Then it will make a tool call to search_listings(vintage graphic tee, size=None, 30) with the 3 parameters it parses from the query. This tool will filter out the listings.json for all the items in the database that match the parameters sorting by relevance. If no results the agent will return early and sugget a helpful message it will not make any further tool calls. If the tool returns selected_item store them in the session memory.

**Step 2:**
<!-- What happens next? What was returned from step 1? What tool is called now? -->
Then the agent will call on suggest_outfit tool it will take in the new items from step 1 and the existing user wardrobe then the agent will build a suggested outfit by combining the new item with existing wardrobe pieces. It will store the suggested outfit. If there is no existing wardrobe it will suggest a general styling from the LLM. 

**Step 3:**
<!-- Continue until the full interaction is complete -->
The next tool call is on create_fit_card which will take a the outfit suggestion and selected_item and create a caption for social media that mentions the item's name, price and platform. If the outfit suggestion is empty, the tool will return a descriptive error. The agent will also store this social media caption.

**Final output to user:**
<!-- What does the user actually see at the end? -->
Finally what the user will see is the UI panels will be populated with the select_items which are all listing details that match their query, the outfit suggestion (using their wardrobe if possible) and a fitcard that contains a social media style description out their awesome thrifted find.
